			<h3>ICS Pygame Project</h3>
			<p>
			My Intro to CS class required me to make a non-violent game with certain requirements, so I decided to make a game where the player is a red ball, trying to dodge white balls that bounce off invisible walls until you get hit. Most of the actual code was written at the last minute, but I had the idea for quite a while. I tried to find a partner for this project, but had no luck, and therefore did it alone, and although the mark wasn't good, and I didn't follow some of the requirements, I'm proud of what I came up with in a short amount of time.

			<h3>ICS Website Design Project</h3>
			<p>
			My Intro to CS class also required me to make a website containing at least 4 pages about myself, along with some other requirements, and host it on GitHub. That website is the one being read right now, as I had nothing else to say at the third page besides my school projects. I didn't finish the project at the deadline, but my teacher was kind enough to give me an extension. That's why I'm up at 3AM making this website.
