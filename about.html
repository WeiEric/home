			<h3>Hobbies</h3>
			<p>
			Hobbies are things humans like to do in their spare time. Mine include, but are not limited to:
			</p>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Skiing</li>
				<li>Playing Video Games</li>
				<li>Drawing</li>
				<li>Spending time with friends</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p>
			There are other things I like as well, but I don't really want to spend the time thinking about it for the entire day, so I'll just list these for now.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Family</h3>
			<p>
			I have a mother, father, and older brother, with my father having a sister and my mother having 3 sisters and a little brother. This means that at family gatherings I, as second youngest, get to earn lots of money in terms of red packets. Of course, I don't view my relatives as simply things that generate money, and I see them as family, but I thought I would add that since it's hard to fill a webpage with things about yourself.
